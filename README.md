## TODO

# By priority order in short term
- Implement diagnostics and testing (the rough debugging is done).
- Implement post-processing
- Make the code more modular

# And then
- Extend the model (3D, Non-Ideal MHD, more sofisticated Riemann solvers, more sophisticated CT ...).
- Clean up the code.
- Integrate in PHARE.
- Add coupling (Fluid-Fluid, Fluid-Hybrid)
