## TODO

# By priority order in short term
- Add a simulation framework with user input and code output.
- Use real physical initial conditions aswell as realistic values for P and T.
- Implement diagnostics and testing.
- Post-processing
- Computation of new dt on each global loop for CFL condition ?

# And then
- Extend the model (3D, Energy Equation instead of hard coded P, Non-Ideal MHD, more sofisticated Riemann solvers).
- Clean up the code.
- Integrate in PHARE.
- Add coupling (Fluid-Fluid, Fluid-Hybrid)
